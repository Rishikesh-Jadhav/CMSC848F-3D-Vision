# CMSC848F-3D-Vision
This repository serves as a record of my academic experience in CMSC848F during the Fall of 2023. It includes my paper reviews, solutions, and code submissions for assignments and projects. Each assignment is organized within its respective folder, complete with accompanying documentation and any necessary resources.

## üìö Course Overview
This 3D Computer Vision course provides a comprehensive journey through the principles and applications of three-dimensional visual data. It focuses on 5 key modules:
 **1. Background** : This module covers fundamental concepts, including 2D - 3D basics, 2.5D, layered depth images, multi-plane images, voxels, meshes, point clouds, and implicit representations.
 
 **2. Classical Multi-view Geometry** : This module includes learnining 	3D Representations, Multiview Depth Estimation, Structure from Motion (SfM) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
 
 **3. Single-View 3D** : This module focuses on single-view 3D techniques. Students gain insight into single-view 3D representation methods, monocular depth estimation, and surface normal estimation.
 
 **4. 3D Scene Representations & Neural Rendering** : Building on the fundamentals, this module explores advanced view synthesis techniques and implicit surface rendering approaches.
 
 **5. 3D Processing and Generation** :This module helps develop proficiency in processing point clouds, covering classification, segmentation, and detection. Additionally, we delve into techniques for processing mesh representations, understanding generative models for 3D data, and exploring dynamic aspects of 3D data.
