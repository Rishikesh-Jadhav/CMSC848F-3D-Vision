# CMSC848F-3D-Vision
This repository serves as a record of my academic experience in CMSC848F during the Fall of 2023. It includes my paper reviews, solutions, and code submissions for assignments and projects. Each assignment is organized within its respective folder, complete with accompanying documentation and any necessary resources.

## üìö Course Overview
This 3D Computer Vision course provides a comprehensive journey through the principles and applications of three-dimensional visual data. It focuses on 5 key modules:
 
 **1. Background** : This module covers fundamental concepts, including 2D - 3D basics, 2.5D, layered depth images, multi-plane images, voxels, meshes, point clouds, and implicit representations.
 
 **2. Classical Multi-view Geometry** : This module includes learnining 	3D Representations, Multiview Depth Estimation, Structure from Motion (SfM) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
 
 **3. Single-View 3D** : This module focuses on single-view 3D techniques. Students gain insight into single-view 3D representation methods, monocular depth estimation, and surface normal estimation.
 
 **4. 3D Scene Representations & Neural Rendering** : Building on the fundamentals, this module explores advanced view synthesis techniques and implicit surface rendering approaches.
 
 **5. 3D Processing and Generation** :This module helps develop proficiency in processing point clouds, covering classification, segmentation, and detection. Additionally, we delve into techniques for processing mesh representations, understanding generative models for 3D data, and exploring dynamic aspects of 3D data.

### [Assignment 2](https://github.com/848f-3DVision/assignment2):  Single View to 3D

- **Learnings from Assignment 2**:

  1. __Exploring Loss Functions:__
     - *Fitting a Voxel Grid :* Understood and implemented binary cross-entropy loss for regressing to 3D binary voxel grids.
     - *Fitting a Point Cloud :* Successfully implemented Chamfer loss for fitting 3D point clouds and wrote custom code for this purpose.
     - *Fitting a Mesh :*  Defined a smoothening loss for fitting a 3D mesh, utilizing pre-defined losses in the PyTorch library.
       
  2. __Reconstructing 3D from Single View:__
     - *Designed an Image to Voxel Grid Model :* Created a neural network to decode binary voxel grids, possibly modifying the provided decoder, and trained the single-view to voxel grid pipeline.
     - *Developed an Image to Point Cloud Model :* Designed a neural network to decode point clouds, similar to voxel grid, and trained the single-view to point cloud pipeline.
     - *Defined an Image to Mesh Model :* Developed a neural network to decode meshes, modified the provided decoder, and trained the single-view to mesh pipeline. Experimented with different mesh initializations.
     - *Conducted Quantitative Comparisons :* Compared F1 scores of 3D reconstruction for meshes, point clouds, and voxel grids and justified the comparison with an intuitive explanation.
     - *Analyzed Effects of Hyperparameter Variations :* Investigated the impact of varying hyperparameters, such as n_points, vox_size, w_chamfer, or initial mesh, on the model's performance.
     - *Interpreted Your Model :* Created insightful visualizations to understand what the learned model does and gained insights into its behavior. This included visualizing feature maps and encoder information.

These learnings encompass a wide range of topics related to 3D reconstruction from single-view RGB input, loss functions, neural network design, and hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, they include the use of PyTorch and PyTorch3D for   implementing these concepts.
