# CMSC848F - Assignment 1: Rendering Basics with PyTorch3D

This repository contains the code and resources for Assignment 1 of the CMSC848F course, focusing on Rendering Basics using PyTorch3D.

## Folder Structure

The `assignment1-main` folder consists of the following directories:

- **data**: Data resources used in the assignment.
- **images**: Contains previous images for reference.
- **output_images_and_GIFS**: This directory stores the output images and GIFs generated during the assignment.
- **starter**: Starter code files for the assignment.
- **report example**: An example of a report associated with this assignment.

## Running the Assignment in Google Colab

To reproduce the results in Google Colab, follow these steps:

1. Extract the contents of this repository and load them into your Google Drive.

2. Open the `CMSC848F_Assignment1.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.

3. The first cell of the notebook will set up the PyTorch3D environment, and the second cell will request permission to access and load files from your Google Drive.

4. After granting permission, you can execute each cell one by one to run the assignment.

**Note**: Please ensure you change the `package_directory` variable to match the directory path where the assignment folders are located. For example:
```python
package_directory = '/content/drive/MyDrive/CMSC848F_Assignment1/assignment1-main'

The results, including images and GIFs, will be stored in the output_images_and_GIFS folder, overwriting existing files. This will not affect the webpage.

Running this assignment on local machines has not been tested. It is recommended to use Google Colab as described above.

Please feel free to reach out with any questions related to the assignment, and I will provide you with clear explanations to address your queries.
